	<h2>Phase 1:</h2>
	<p>The goal of this exercise is to practice quickly recognizing the value
		of of first the opening hand (including recognizing "soft" hands).
		Then an additional card will be dealt, and this will prompt a new
		answer for the total value of the hand. Then
		the excercise will move on to the next hand.
		Once all eleven hands are completed, phase two will begin.</p>
	<h2>Phase 2:</h2>
	<p>The beginning of phase two is indicated by the border around the answer
		area turning green, from now on, the goal is to (starting with the last
		hand dealt), to give the highest answer (under 21 if possible)
		for the given hand. Phase 2 will continue with all the hands in order,
		moving backwards. Once the final hand is
		answered correctly, the exercise will conclude.</p>
